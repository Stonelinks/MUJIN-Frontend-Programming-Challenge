The whole challenge is graded on a scale of 0 to 100. 100 is amazing while a 50 or below is pretty terrible.

Each requirement is scored on a scale of 0 to 10. 0 means the candidate straight up did nothing to meet the requirement while 10 means they fulfilled it in every possible way and did an awesome job at it.

Each requirement is additionally weighted on its relative importance on a scale of 1 to 10. A requirement that is weighted 1 isn't super important, while ones weighted 10 are very important relative to other requirements. 5 is sort of normal importance and is where most requirements should start out.

The candidate's grade is calculated by a weighted average of their score on each requirement and then multiplied by 10. It should be pretty easy to whip up a spreadsheet that does this.
